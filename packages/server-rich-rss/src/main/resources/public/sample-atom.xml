    <title>Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking</title>
    <content>&lt;![CDATA[Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking May 6, 2013 by Daniel C. Dennett ( 305 ) $9.99
      Over a storied career, Daniel C. Dennett has engaged questions about science and the workings of the mind. His
      answers have combined rigorous argument with strong empirical grounding. And a lot of fun. Intuition Pumps and
      Other Tools for Thinking offers seventy-seven of Dennett’s most successful "imagination-extenders and
      focus-holders" meant to guide you through some of life’s most treacherous subject matter: evolution, meaning,
      mind, and free will. With patience and wit, Dennett deftly deploys his thinking tools to gain traction on these
      thorny issues while offering readers insight into how and why each tool was built. Alongside well-known favorites
      like Occam’s Razor and reductio ad absurdum lie thrilling descriptions of Dennett’s own creations: Trapped in the
      Robot Control Room, Beware of the Prime Mammal, and The Wandering Two-Bitser. Ranging across disciplines as
      diverse as psychology, biology, computer science, and physics, Dennett’s tools embrace in equal measure
      light-heartedness and accessibility as they welcome uninitiated and seasoned readers alike. As always, his goal
      remains to teach you how to "think reliably and even gracefully about really hard questions." A sweeping work of
      intellectual seriousness that’s also studded with impish delights, Intuition Pumps offers intrepid thinkers—in all
      walks of life—delicious opportunities to explore their pet ideas with new powers. Read more Other Formats: Audible

    <title>Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon</title>
    <content>&lt;![CDATA[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon Feb 2, 2006 by Daniel C. Dennett ( 468 )
      $5.99 The New York Times bestseller – a “crystal-clear, constantly engaging” (Jared Diamond) exploration of the
      role that religious belief plays in our lives and our interactions For all the thousands of books that have been
      written about religion, few until this one have attempted to examine it scientifically: to ask why—and how—it has
      shaped so many lives so strongly. Is religion a product of blind evolutionary instinct or rational choice? Is it
      truly the best way to live a moral life? Ranging through biology, history, and psychology, Daniel C. Dennett
      charts religion’s evolution from “wild” folk belief to “domesticated” dogma. Not an antireligious screed but an
      unblinking look beneath the veil of orthodoxy, Breaking the Spell will be read and debated by believers and
      skeptics alike. Read more Other Formats: Audible Audiobook , Hardcover , Paperback See purchase options]]

    <title>Kinds Of Minds: Toward An Understanding Of Consciousness (Science Masters Series)</title>
    <content>&lt;![CDATA[Kinds Of Minds: Toward An Understanding Of Consciousness (Science Masters Series) Aug 4, 2008
      by Daniel C. Dennett ( 33 ) $9.99 Combining ideas from philosophy, artificial intelligence, and neurobiology,
      Daniel Dennett leads the reader on a fascinating journey of inquiry, exploring such intriguing possibilities as:
      Can any of us really know what is going on in someone else's mind? What distinguishes the human mind from the
      minds of animals, especially those capable of complex behavior? If such animals, for instance, were magically
      given the power of language, would their communities evolve an intelligence as subtly discriminating as ours? Will
      robots, once they have been endowed with sensory systems like those that provide us with experience, ever exhibit
      the particular traits long thought to distinguish the human mind, including the ability to think about thinking?
      Dennett addresses these questions from an evolutionary perspective. Beginning with the macromolecules of DNA and
      RNA, the author shows how, step-by-step, animal life moved from the simple ability to respond to frequently
      recurring environmental conditions to much more powerful ways of beating the odds, ways of using patterns of past
      experience to predict the future in never-before-encountered situations. Whether talking about robots whose
      video-camera "eyes" give us the powerful illusion that "there is somebody in there" or asking us to consider
      whether spiders are just tiny robots mindlessly spinning their webs of elegant design, Dennett is a master at
      finding and posing questions sure to stimulate and even disturb. Read more Other Formats: Audible Audiobook ,

    <title>Brainstorms, Fortieth Anniversary Edition: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology</title>
    <content>&lt;![CDATA[Brainstorms, Fortieth Anniversary Edition: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology Dec 15,
      2017 by Daniel C. Dennett ( 14 ) $25.99 An anniversary edition of a classic in cognitive science, with a new
      introduction by the author. When Brainstorms was published in 1978, the interdisciplinary field of cognitive
      science was just emerging. Daniel Dennett was a young scholar who wanted to get philosophers out of their
      armchairs—and into conversations with psychologists, linguists, computer scientists. This collection of seventeen
      essays by Dennett offers a comprehensive theory of mind, encompassing traditional issues of consciousness and free
      will. Using careful arguments and ingenious thought experiments, the author exposes familiar preconceptions and
      hobbling intuitions. The essays are grouped into four sections: “Intentional Explanation and Attributions of
      Mentality”; “The Nature of Theory in Psychology”; “Objects of Consciousness and the Nature of Experience”; and
      “Free Will and Personhood.” This anniversary edition includes a new introduction by Dennett, “Reflections on
      Brainstorms after Forty Years,” in which he recalls the book's original publication by Harry and Betty Stanton of
      Bradford Books and considers the influence and afterlife of some of the essays. For example, “Mechanism and
      Responsibility” was Dennett's first articulation of his concept of the intentional stance; “Are Dreams
      Experiences?” anticipates the major ideas in his 1991 book Consciousness Explained; and “Where Am I?” has been
      variously represented in a BBC documentary, a student's Javanese shadow puppet play, and a feature-length film
      made in the Netherlands, Victim of the Brain. Read more Other Formats: Hardcover , Paperback Buy now with 1-Click

    <title>Elbow Room, new edition: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting</title>
    <content>&lt;![CDATA[Elbow Room, new edition: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting Aug 7, 2015 by Daniel C.
      Dennett ( 36 ) $18.99 A landmark book in the debate over free will that makes the case for compatibilism. In this
      landmark 1984 work on free will, Daniel Dennett makes a case for compatibilism. His aim, as he writes in the
      preface to this new edition, was a cleanup job, “saving everything that mattered about the everyday concept of
      free will, while jettisoning the impediments.” In Elbow Room, Dennett argues that the varieties of free will worth
      wanting—those that underwrite moral and artistic responsibility—are not threatened by advances in science but
      distinguished, explained, and justified in detail. Dennett tackles the question of free will in a highly original
      and witty manner, drawing on the theories and concepts of fields that range from physics and evolutionary biology
      to engineering, automata theory, and artificial intelligence. He shows how the classical formulations of the
      problem in philosophy depend on misuses of imagination, and he disentangles the philosophical problems of real
      interest from the “family of anxieties” in which they are often enmeshed—imaginary agents and bogeymen, including
      the Peremptory Puppeteer, the Nefarious Neurosurgeon, and the Cosmic Child Whose Dolls We Are. Putting
      sociobiology in its rightful place, he concludes that we can have free will and science too. He explores reason,
      control and self-control, the meaning of “can” and “could have done otherwise,” responsibility and punishment, and
      why we would want free will in the first place. A fresh reading of Dennett's book shows how much it can still
      contribute to current discussions of free will. This edition includes as its afterword Dennett's 2012 Erasmus
      Prize essay. Read more Other Formats: Audible Audiobook , Hardcover , Paperback , Audio CD Buy now with 1-Click ®

    <title>Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind</title>
    <content>&lt;![CDATA[Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind May 1, 2015 by Daniel C. Dennett , Linda LaScola ,
      Richard Dawkins ( 110 ) $8.99 What is it like to be a preacher or rabbi who no longer believes in God? In this
      expanded and updated edition of their groundbreaking study, Daniel C. Dennett and Linda LaScola comprehensively
      and sensitively expose an inconvenient truth that religious institutions face in the new transparency of the
      information age—the phenomenon of clergy who no longer believe what they publicly preach. In confidential
      interviews, clergy from across the ministerial spectrum—from liberal to literal—reveal how their lives of
      religious service and study have led them to a truth inimical to their professed beliefs and profession. Although
      their personal stories are as varied as the denominations they once represented, or continue to represent—whether
      Catholic, Baptist, Episcopalian, Methodist, Mormon, Pentecostal, or any of numerous others—they give voice not
      only to their own struggles but also to those who similarly suffer in tender and lonely silence. As this study
      poignantly and vividly reveals, their common journey has far-reaching implications not only for their families,
      their congregations, and their communities—but also for the very future of religion. Read more Other Formats:

    <title>Inside Jokes: Using Humor to Reverse-Engineer the Mind</title>
    <content>&lt;![CDATA[Inside Jokes: Using Humor to Reverse-Engineer the Mind Mar 4, 2011 by Matthew M. Hurley ,
      Daniel C. Dennett , Reginald B. Adams ( 45 ) $18.99 An evolutionary and cognitive account of the addictive mind
      candy that is humor. Some things are funny—jokes, puns, sitcoms, Charlie Chaplin, The Far Side, Malvolio with his
      yellow garters crossed—but why? Why does humor exist in the first place? Why do we spend so much of our time
      passing on amusing anecdotes, making wisecracks, watching The Simpsons? In Inside Jokes, Matthew Hurley, Daniel
      Dennett, and Reginald Adams offer an evolutionary and cognitive perspective. Humor, they propose, evolved out of a
      computational problem that arose when our long-ago ancestors were furnished with open-ended thinking. Mother
      Nature—aka natural selection—cannot just order the brain to find and fix all our time-pressured misleaps and
      near-misses. She has to bribe the brain with pleasure. So we find them funny. This wired-in source of pleasure has
      been tickled relentlessly by humorists over the centuries, and we have become addicted to the endogenous mind
      candy that is humor. Read more Other Formats: Hardcover , Paperback Buy now with 1-Click ® Sold by: Amazon.com

    <title>The Mystery of Consciousness</title>
    <content>&lt;![CDATA[The Mystery of Consciousness Sep 14, 2020 by John R. Searle ( 70 ) $7.99 It has long been one
      of the most fundamental problems of philosophy, and it is now, John Searle writes, "the most important problem in
      the biological sciences": What is consciousness? Is my inner awareness of myself something separate from my body?
      In what began as a series of essays in The New York Review of Books, John Searle evaluates the positions on
      consciousness of such well-known scientists and philosophers as Francis Crick, Gerald Edelman, Roger Penrose,
      Daniel Dennett, David Chalmers, and Israel Rosenfield. He challenges claims that the mind works like a computer,
      and that brain functions can be reproduced by computer programs. With a sharp eye for confusion and contradiction,
      he points out which avenues of current research are most likely to come up with a biological examination of how
      conscious states are caused by the brain. Only when we understand how the brain works will we solve the mystery of
      consciousness, and only then will we begin to understand issues ranging from artificial intelligence to our very
      nature as human beings. Read more Other Formats: Paperback Buy now with 1-Click ® Sold by: Amazon.com Services

    <title>Freedom Evolves</title>
    <content>&lt;![CDATA[Freedom Evolves Jan 27, 2004 by Daniel C. Dennett ( 92 ) $7.99 Can there be freedom and free
      will in a deterministic world? Renowned philosopher Daniel Dennett emphatically answers “yes!” Using an array of
      provocative formulations, Dennett sets out to show how we alone among the animals have evolved minds that give us
      free will and morality. Weaving a richly detailed narrative, Dennett explains in a series of strikingly original
      arguments—drawing upon evolutionary biology, cognitive neuroscience, economics, and philosophy—that far from being
      an enemy of traditional explorations of freedom, morality, and meaning, the evolutionary perspective can be an
      indispensable ally. In Freedom Evolves, Dennett seeks to place ethics on the foundation it deserves: a realistic,
      naturalistic, potentially unified vision of our place in nature. Read more Other Formats: Audible Audiobook ,
