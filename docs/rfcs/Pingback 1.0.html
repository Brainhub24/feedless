  <h2><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h2>

  <p>Pingback is a method for web authors to request notification when
  somebody links to one of their documents. Typically, web publishing
  software will automatically inform the relevant parties on behalf of
  the user, allowing for the possibility of automatically creating
  links to referring documents.</p>
 
  <p>For example, Alice writes an interesting article on her Web log.
  Bob then reads this article and comments about it, linking back to
  Alice's original post. Using pingback, Bob's software can
  automatically notify Alice that her post has been linked to, and
  Alice's software can then include this information on her site.</p>

  <h2><a name="TOC1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>

  <p>The pingback system is a way for a blog to be automatically
  notified when other Web sites link to it. It is entirely transparent
  to the linking author, requiring no user intervention to work, and
  operates on principles of automatic discovery of everything that it
  needs to know. <a name="introexample">A</a> sample blog post
  involving pingback might go like this:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>Alice posts to her blog. The post she's made includes a link to
   a post on Bob's blog.</li>
   <li>Alice's blogging system contacts Bob's blogging system and says
   "look, Alice made a post which linked to one of your posts".</li>
   <li>Bob's blogging system then includes a link back to Alice's post
   on his original post.</li>
   <li>Reader's of Bob's article can follow this link to Alice's post
   to read her opinion.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>It enables reverse linking &mdash; a way of going back up a chain of
  links rather than merely drilling down.</p>

  <h3><a name="TOC1.1"></a>1.1. Technical Details</h3>

  <p>The pingback mechanism uses an HTTP header and an HTML or XHTML
  <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element for autodiscovery, and uses a
  single XML-RPC call for notifying the target site of the link on the
  source site.</p>

  <p>It is intended that <a href="#compliant">compliant</a> pingback
  clients and pingback servers be implementable with minimal effort
  using libraries typically available in CGI environments. For this
  reason, the requirements on parsing HTTP headers and HTML documents
  have been kept to a strict minimum.</p>

  <h2><a name="TOC2"></a>2. Server Autodiscovery</h2>

  <p>There are two mechanisms for the automatic discovery of pingback
  servers: HTML (or XHTML) <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements and HTTP
  headers. A <a href="#pingbackenabledpage">pingback-enabled
  resource</a> MUST either be served with an <a
  href="#header"><code>X-Pingback</code> HTTP header</a> or contain a
  <a href="#link"><code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element</a>, or both.
  Pingback-enabled HTML and XHTML pages MUST be valid. Clients MAY
  refuse to search invalid pages for pingback information.</p>

  <p>Note that how the client is told of the source and target URIs is
  out of the scope of this specification. Typically blogs will extract
  external links from posts being made to find the target URIs.</p>


  <h3><a name="TOC2.1">2.1. HTTP Header</a></h3>

  <p><a name="header" href="#pingbackenabledpage">Pingback-enabled
  resources</a> MAY be returned with a <code>X-Pingback</code> HTTP
  header. For example, a PNG image served with the following headers
  would be pingback-enabled:

  <pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 08 Sep 2002 15:05:37 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.26 (Unix)
Last-Modified: Thu, 28 Dec 2000 03:18:26 GMT
ETag: "65044-15b9c-3a4ab102"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 88988
Connection: close
Content-Type: image/png
<strong>X-Pingback: http://charlie.example.com/pingback/xmlrpc</strong>

.PNG...
  </pre>

  <p>The value of the <code>X-Pingback</code> header MUST be the
  <em>absolute</em> URI of the pingback XML-RPC server.</p>

  <p>Pages MUST NOT include more than one such header. HTML and XHTML
  documents MAY include a <a href="#link"><code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
  element</a> in addition to an HTTP header, although this is
  discouraged. If included, the header SHOULD have exactly the same
  value as the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element. In the case of a
  discrepancy, the HTTP header SHALL override the
  <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element, however, authors should be aware
  that some clients will not process HTTP headers due to limitations
  of their environment.</p>

  <p>Pingback-enabled resources MUST NOT use the HTTP
  <code>Link</code> header for advertising pingback servers. HTTP
  <code>Link</code> headers require non-trivial parsing, and were
  therefore deemed too heavy-duty for the purposes of pingback server
  autodiscovery.</p>


  <h3><a name="TOC2.2">2.2. Link Element</a></h3>

  <p>An HTML or XHTML <a name="link"
  href="#pingbackenabledpage">pingback-enabled page</a> MAY contain a
  <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element in one of the following two
  forms:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>HTML</dt>
   <dd><pre>&lt;link rel="pingback" href="<var>pingback server</var>"&gt;</pre></dd>
   <dt>XHTML</dt>
   <dd><pre>&lt;link rel="pingback" href="<var>pingback server</var>" /&gt;</pre></dd>
  </dl>

  <p>If used, the link element MUST match the appropriate form exactly
  (including the whitespace before the slash, for instance).</p>

  <p>Pages MUST NOT include more than one such element, and MUST NOT
  include such a string matching the <a href="#pattern">pattern</a>
  described below unless it is intended to be the link element.</p>

  <p>The <var>pingback server</var> placeholder MUST be replaced by
  the <em>absolute</em> URI of the pingback XML-RPC server. This URI
  MUST NOT include entities other than <code>&amp;amp;</code>,
  <code>&amp;lt;</code>, <code>&amp;gt;</code>, and
  <code>&amp;quot;</code>. Other characters that would not be valid in
  the HTML document or that cannot be represented in the document's
  character encoding MUST be escaped using the <code>%xx</code>
  mechanism as described in [<a href="#refs2396">RFC2396</a>].</p>

  <p class="note">These strict requirements are intended to
  drastically reduce the requirements on clients implementing server
  autodiscovery, as it was deemed that requiring clients to implement
  an HTML parser in addition to an XML parser was a too heavy burden,
  given how easy it would be for page authors to comply to the
  restrictions described above.</p>


  <h3><a name="TOC2.3">2.3. Autodiscovery Algorithm</a></h3>

  <p><a name="autodiscovery" href="#pingbackclient">Pingback
  clients</a>, given a source URI and a target URI, SHOULD fetch the
  target URI and follow the following steps to find the pingback
  server URI.</p>

  <ol>

   <li>Examine the HTTP headers of the response. If there are any
   <code>X-Pingback</code> headers then the first such header's value
   should be used as the pingback server URI. Clients MUST examine the
   HTTP headers if they are able to. If for some reason the HTTP
   headers are not available to the implementation then this step MAY
   be skipped, however, implementers should be aware that this will
   reduce the usefulness of their application as link elements cannot
   be used for resources that are neither HTML nor XHTML, and HTTP
   headers are defined to override link elements when they
   differ.</li>

   <li>Otherwise, search the entity body for the first match of the
   following regular expression:
   <pre id="pattern">&lt;link rel="pingback" href="<strong>([^"]+)</strong>" ?/?&gt;</pre>
   </li>

   <li>If the regular expression matched, clients MUST then expand the
   four allowed entities (<code>&amp;amp;</code> for
   <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&amp;lt;</code> for <code>&lt;</code>,
   <code>&amp;gt;</code> for <code>&gt;</code>, and
   <code>&amp;quot;</code> for <code>&quot;</code>).</li>

  </ol>

  <p>Having extracted this pingback server URI, it SHOULD be used to
  <a href="#send">send an XML-RPC request</a> as described below. </p>

  <p>If the there is no <code>X-Pingback</code> header and the regular
  expression does not match, then the target in question does not
  support pingback as defined by this specification and the client MAY
  do whatever it likes. However, it is RECOMMENDED that clients <em>do
  not</em> attempt to be more lenient (e.g. by correctly parsing the
  HTML and looking for <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements that look
  like pingback links from an HTML point of view) because this will
  lead to some systems recognising the link and others ignoring
  it.</p>

  <p>Clients MAY optimise the search. For example:</p>

  <ul>

   <li>The client MAY initally only send an HTTP HEAD request in the
   hope that the header will be found and the content will not have to
   be fetched.</li>

   <li>Since <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements may only appear in the
   document's head, clients MAY abort when the strings
   <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> are seen
   (e.g. if the client reads the content one line at a time).</li>

   <li>Since the pingback links are most likely to appear near the top
   of the document, clients MAY abort the search after passing a
   certain size threshold. Clients MAY similarly use the HTTP
   <code>Content-Range</code> header to only fetch the first few
   kilobytes of the target URI.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Note, however, that these optimisations are prone to being caught
  out by legitimate documents, for example those having comments
  containing the strings given above, or those with large inline
  stylesheets appearing before the pingback link. Authors are
  encouraged to take these possible optimisations into account when
  deciding where to place their pingback links.</p>

  <h2><a name="TOC3"></a>3. XML-RPC Interface</h2>

  <p><a name="send">Pingback clients</a>, having discovered a pingback
  server, SHOULD send the server an XML-RPC request with the method
  name <code>pingback.ping</code> and two arguments, the source URI
  and the target URI respectively. [<a href="#refsXMLRPC">XML-RPC</a>]</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><code>pingback.ping</code></dt>
   <dd>
    Notifies the server that a link has been added to
    <var>sourceURI</var>, pointing to <var>targetURI</var>.
    <dl>
     <dt>Parameters</dt>
     <dd>
      <dl>
       <dt><var>sourceURI</var> of type <code>string</code></dt>
       <dd>The absolute URI of the post on the source page containing
       the link to the target site.</dd>
       <dt><var>targetURI</var> of type <code>string</code></dt>
       <dd>The absolute URI of the target of the link, as given on the
       source page.</dd>
      </dl>
     </dd>
     <dt>Return Value</dt>
     <dd>A <code>string</code>, as described below.</dd>
     <dt>Faults</dt>
     <dd>

      If an error condition occurs, then the appropriate fault code
      from the following list should be used. Clients can quickly
      determine the kind of error from bits 5-8. 0&times;001x fault
      codes are used for problems with the source URI, 0&times;002x
      codes are for problems with the target URI, and 0&times;003x
      codes are used when the URIs are fine but the pingback cannot be
      acknowledged for some other reaon.

      <dl id="return">

       <dt>0</dt> <dd>A generic fault code. Servers MAY use this error
       code instead of any of the others if they do not have a way of
       determining the correct fault code.</dd>

       <dt>0&times;0010 (16)</dt> <dd>The source URI does not exist.</dd>

       <dt>0&times;0011 (17)</dt> <dd>The source URI does not contain a link to
       the target URI, and so cannot be used as a source.</dd>

       <dt>0&times;0020 (32)</dt> <dd>The specified target URI does
       not exist. This MUST only be used when the target definitely
       does not exist, rather than when the target may exist but is
       not recognised. See the next error.</dd>

       <dt>0&times;0021 (33)</dt> <dd>The specified target URI cannot
       be used as a target. It either doesn't exist, or it is not a
       pingback-enabled resource. For example, on a blog, typically
       only permalinks are pingback-enabled, and trying to pingback
       the home page, or a set of posts, will fail with this
       error.</dd>

       <dt>0&times;0030 (48)</dt> <dd>The pingback has already been
       registered.</dd>

       <dt>0&times;0031 (49)</dt> <dd>Access denied.</dd>

       <dt>0&times;0032 (50)</dt> <dd>The server could not communicate
       with an upstream server, or received an error from an upstream
       server, and therefore could not complete the request. This is
       similar to HTTP's 402 Bad Gateway error. This error SHOULD be
       used by pingback proxies when propagating errors.</dd>

      </dl>

      In addition, [<a href="#refsFaultCodes">FaultCodes</a>] defines
      some standard fault codes that servers MAY use to report higher
      level errors.

     </dd>

    </dl>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Servers MUST respond to this function call either with a single
  string or with a fault code.</p>

  <p>If the pingback request is successful, then the return value MUST
  be a single string, containing as much information as the server
  deems useful. This string is only expected to be used for debugging
  purposes.</p>

  <p>If the result is unsuccessful, then the server MUST respond with
  an RPC fault value. The fault code should be either one of the codes
  listed above, or the generic fault code zero if the server cannot
  determine the correct fault code.</p>

  <p>Clients MAY ignore the return value, whether the request was
  successful or not. It is RECOMMENDED that clients do not show the
  result of successful requests to the user.</p>

  <p>Upon receiving a request, servers MAY do what they like. However,
  the following steps are RECOMMENDED:</p>

  <ol>

   <li>The server MAY attempt to fetch the source URI to verify that
   the source does indeed link to the target.</li>

   <li>The server MAY check its own data to ensure that the target
   exists and is a valid entry.</li>

   <li>The server MAY check that the pingback has not already been
   registered.</li>

   <li>The server MAY record the pingback.</li>

   <li>The server MAY regenerate the site's pages (if the pages are
   static).</li>

  </ol>

  <h2><a name="TOC4"></a>4. Conformance Requirements</h2>

  <p>To claim <a name="compliant">conformance</a> to this
  specification a <strong>pingback client</strong> MUST support <a
  href="#autodiscovery">server autodiscovery</a> as described in this
  specification and MUST correctly send <a href="#send">pingback
  XML-RPC calls</a>.</p>

  <p>To claim conformance to this specification a <strong>pingback

  <p>Note that some pingback servers may not have associated pages.
  For example, a pingback gateway server could be standalone, and
  other pages would then use the link element to link to this gateway
  server instead of providing a server of their own. To claim
  conformance to this specification a <strong>pingback-enabled

  <h2><a name="TOC5"></a>5. Example</h2>

  <p>Here is a more detailed look at what could happen between Alice
  and Bob during the example described in the <a
  href="#introexample">introduction</a>.</p>

  <ol>

   <li>Alice posts to her blog. The post she's made includes a link to
   a post on Bob's blog. The permalink to Alice's new post is
   <code>http://alice.example.org/#p123</code>, and the URL of the
   link to Bob's blog is
   <code>http://bob.example.net/#foo</code>.</li>

   <li>Alice's blogging system parses all the external links out of Alice's 
   post, and finds <code>http://bob.example.net/#foo</code>.</li>

   <li>It then requests the first 5 kilobytes of the page referred
   to by the link.</li>

   <li>It looks for an <code>X-Pingback</code> header, but fails to
   find one.</li>

   <li>It scans this page fragment for the pingback link tag, which it
   finds:

    <pre>&lt;link rel="pingback" href="http://bob.example.net/xmlrpcserver"&gt;</pre>

   If this tag had not been contained in the page, then Bob's blog
   would not support pingback, so Alice's software would have given up
   here (moving on to the next link found in step 2).</li>

   <li>Next, since the link <em>was</em> there, it executes the the
   following XML-RPC call to
   <code>http://bob.example.net/xmlrpcserver</code>:

    <pre>pingback.ping('http://alice.example.org/#p123', 'http://bob.example.net/#foo')</pre>

   </li>

   <li>Alice's blogging system repeats step 3 to 6 for each external
   link that was found in the post.</li>

  <p>There ends the work undertaken by Alice's system. The rest of the
  work is performed by Bob's blog.</p>
   
  <ol>

   <li>Bob's blog receives a ping from Alice's blog (the ping sent in
   step 6 above), naming <code>http://alice.example.org/#p123</code>
   (the site linking to Bob) and
   <code>http://bob.example.net/#foo</code> (the page Alice linked
   to).</li>

   <li>Bob's blog confirms that
   <code>http://bob.example.net/#foo</code> is in fact a post on this
   blog.</li>

   <li>It then requests the content of
   <code>http://alice.example.org/#p123</code> and checks the
   Content-Type of the entity returned to make sure it is text of some
   sort.</li>

   <li>It verifies that this content does indeed contain a link to
   <code>http://bob.example.net/#foo</code> (to prevent spamming of
   pingbacks).</li>

   <li>Bob's blog also retrieves other data required from the content
   of Alice's new post, such as the page title, an extract of the page
   content surrounding the link to Bob's post, any attributes
   indicating which language the page is in, and so forth.</li>

   <li>Finally, Bob's post records the pingback in its database, and
   regenerates the static pages referring to Bob's post so that they
   mention the pingback.</li>
