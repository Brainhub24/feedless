# Monetization

For a large degree `Monetization` (M) is achieved through Ads. Ad-driven business models gained a huge success due to simple integration. Ad-driven `M` for feeds is particularly tricky, 
which is one reason big players abandoned it.

I am a fan of subscription=models. [Ars Technica](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26405465) uses this model to deliver full-text feeds. I consider this a very 
interesting approach that could work for rich-rss, with the goal to reward the content producers and brokers. The payout could be executed in a way flattr handled it: 
per payout interval a user has a budget of x, which is equally split between all content producers. Additionaly, since curation is an important topic, I want to consider 
to reward the brokers too. So the the content producers would share a fraction with the broker.

Example:
- User Bob pays 10$/month for a `rich-rss` subscription
- Bob consumes a fulltext Article_1 via Broker_1 from Producer_1
- Bob consumes a fulltext Article_2 via Broker_2 via Broker_1 from Producer_2
- - Bob consumes a fulltext Article_2 via Broker_2 via Broker_1 from Producer_2
