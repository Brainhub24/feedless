# Other
- other interesting sources are telegram groups, email
- preprocessing steps before running rss-proxy: click here and here...

# Engagement
As an producer I want to monitor the behavior of other users
As a consumer I want to engage with other users by sharing/liking/commenting on articles
    As a consumer I want to read other people activity for an article I am interested in
As a consumer I don't want to be spammed
As a consumer I want to see comments of people I don't know


It should be able to engage with other users - maybe to stay consistent with existing approaches like twitter - in
the following ways:
- comment
- like, share / retweet or archive

  - archive: you network
  - inbox: suggested articles that are related to an archived article

# Archive Funktion
Wenn man einen guten Artikel `a` archivieren will, soll `a` nicht nur plump in eine Liste 
gesteckt werden. Gem채ss dem Zettelkastenprinzip soll jeder Artikel mit mindestens einem anderen verlinkt werden mussen
um einen Kontext zu schaffen. Jeder Artikel im feed soll dann links anf체hren, unabh채ngig vom Content. 
Links: Artikel -> Artikel

- add feed to bucket
  - choose a feed from several potential feeds (native, rss-proxy, nitter)
  - see a feeds entries
