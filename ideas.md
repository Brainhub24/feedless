# Other
- subscription should have a size of items that it maximally contains
- other interesting sources are telegram groups, email
- preprocessing steps before running rss-proxy: click here and here...
- validation if feed is still working

# Engagement
As an producer I want to monitor the behavior of other users
As a consumer I want to engage with other users by sharing/liking/commenting on articles
    As a consumer I want to read other people activity for an article I am interested in
As a consumer I don't want to be spammed
As a consumer I want to see comments of people I don't know


It should be able to engage with other users - maybe to stay consistent with existing approaches like twitter - in
the following ways:
- comment
- like, share / retweet or archive


# Use Cases
- throttle a subscription(source)
- filter a subscription group
